Homework: Variable Type vs Object Type                           by Veronica Luongo


1.    Which of the followings is considered boxing?

        a. double dblx = fx;
        b. float fx = ix;
        c. object myobjx = fx;
        d. int ix = objy;

Answer:  c


2.    Which of the followings is considered unboxing?

        a. string str = ix.ToString();
        b. double dblx =(double) fx;
        c. object myobjx = fx;
        d. int ix = (int) objy;

Answer:  d


3.    Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.

        float fx = objdblx;

Answer:  float fx = (float)(double)objdblx;



4.    Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object o another variable of type double.

        double dx = objflx;

Answer:          double dx = (double)(float)objflx;


5.    Convert the string strx to a double dblx:

        double dblx =

Answer:  double dblx = double.Parse(strx);


6.    Convert the integer ix to a float fx:

        float fx =

Answer:         float fx = ix;


7.    Convert the double dblx to a string strx:

        string strx =

Answer:   string strx = dblx.ToString();


8.    Object is the                class of all other data types.

Answer:   base


9.    What is an object (the definition)?

Answer:  Objet is a type that is the mother of all other types. It has to have functionality, definition, and properties.


10.    How do you declare an object in C#?

Answer:  by adding the word object in front of the object name and then assign anything I want
for example:  object myObject = myInt;  //myInt is an int that I declared previously

this particular example, is also called boxing.


11.    What is the difference between an object and a variable?

Answer:  variables can be converted directly through casting
	 objects need to be unboxed first, finding out what type it is using the GetType() method, and then assign it to a variable.
